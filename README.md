## **Assignment 2** ##

In this assignemnt we had to help John with two tasks. First we had to dwonload 1000 and then resize them to 128x128 using threading and multiprocessing. 
In order to download the 1000 (or less) photos from imgur we first had to get a client ID. 

For some reason I was unable to download even 500 photos from the internet even though my code was running. It gave me 'api limit reached' multiple times even though I have tried different options.

I used threading to import my photos ar created a function called 'Download'
To resize them I used multiprocessing with a function of the same name.

At the end I created a table for the four approaches and the time for those tasks even though I am still missing two of them. I used panda's table library in order to create the table.
